*	RDSSource – sourcemf

6 Lambda functions to generate data for different source.

*	c360viewGetCRMApi
*	c360viewGetGaTables
*	c360viewMFgenAccount
*	c360viewMFgenCard
*	c360viewMFgenGBank
5 CloudWatch events schedules, to trigger the Lambda functions.

2 Security group, firewalls, one for the EC2 instance, other for Replication instances and Lambda functions.
